Part 1: Flask App Containerization & Deployment

Here's what we need to do with the app.py file:

1. Create a Dockerfile to containerize this Flask app
2. Write K8s manifests for deployment 
3. Set up a dummy URL endpoint

Key things to keep in mind:
- We're adding this to an existing K8s cluster that's already running multiple web apps
- This needs to be production-ready - think HA, scalability, the works
- Don't hardcode pod ports to the host
- Keep it DRY - we might spin up 20+ similar apps later, so let's be smart about resource usage and make this easily replicable
